# Cultural-semantic-similarity-network
### Overview
This github project provides readers 1 dataset, 2 ArcgisPro toolboxes, and 2 codes, which are **Cultural semantics of Chinese cities.zip**, **ArcPy_Demo.tbx**, **Network-Construction.tbx**, **ResultTableV2.py**, and **odline.py**. The following content will introduce their founction one by one.  
### Cultural semantics of Chinese cities.zip
The compressed file contains a Chinese cities shapefile with cultural semantics. Each city is defined with a **9-dimensional cultrual eigenvetor**. It is the most important data basis in this study.  
### Network-Construction.tbx and ResultTableV2.
This tool can calculate the cultural similarity among cities based on **Cultural semantic of Chinese cities**, and construct a **Cultural Semantic Similarity Network** OD Table.
### ArcPy_Demo.tbx and odline.py
This tool can be used to visualize the **Network Origin-Destination Table** in ArcGIS Pro.
